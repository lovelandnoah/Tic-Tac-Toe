Basic Objectives:
  √  1) create a tic tac toe board in html
  √   2) write javascript to place alternating X's and O's on the board
  √   3) don't allow a square that has already been clicked to be clicked again(hint: google how to add classes to elements on click)
  4) every time a X or O is laid down check the board to see if any more moves are available / if X's or O's has won
  5) if no more moves are available you probably have a  cats game because you should have been checking for wins

Bonus Objectives:
  1) have a way to clear out the board for a new game without refreshing the browser
  2) have the ability for 2 players to enter their names and alert each player when it is their turn
  3) style it all nice using bootstrap or materialize 
  4) keep track of players wins / loses / ties (* of course this will go away when you refresh your browser because we aren't saving that anywhere)
  5) have the ability to play 2 different versions of the tic tac toe game
      a) version 1 is 2 human players against each other 
      b) version 2 is 1 human player against a computer player
      
  6) instead of just X's and O's text in the boxes, figure out how to add images on click (hint: you can do this via css)
